Questions:
1. What is an Algorithm?

Ans: step by step procedure to slove a given task
2. What do you understand by O notations.

Ans: it is the time used to measure the time taken to execute the program
3. What are NP hard and NP complete problems.

Ans: NP hard is the time taken by the problem to compelete in the expected time.
Np complete is when the problem gets completed in time before the expected time.

4. Give some popular scenarios where time complexity is the key for chosing an algorigthm.

Ans:Depending upon requirement you may want to use any of these.

Merge Sort
Quick Sort
Bucket Sort
Heap Sort
Counting Sort
More importantly one should know when and where to use them. Some examples where you can find direct application of sorting techniques include:

Sorting by price, popularity etc in e-commerce websites
Sorting by score in HackerEarth contest leaderboard

5. How do we calculate time complexity of a program.
Ans:
we calculate the time complexity by the number of iterations
